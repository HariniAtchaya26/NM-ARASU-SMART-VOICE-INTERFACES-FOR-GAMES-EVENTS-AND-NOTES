Voice-based Notes and Memo
Systems
Introduction:
In today‚Äôs fast-paced digital world, capturing ideas, reminders, and memos efficiently
is crucial for productivity. Traditional typing-based note-taking methods can be
time-consuming and inconvenient, especially during multitasking or while on the move.
Voice-based note and memo systems provide a hands-free, quick, and natural way of
recording information using speech recognition technology.
This project aims to develop a voice-enabled memo system that allows users to create, store,
and retrieve notes using simple voice commands. It enhances accessibility, reduces the
cognitive load of manual typing, and supports faster documentation for personal and
professional use.

Problem Statement:
Users often struggle to capture quick thoughts or important reminders when busy or in
motion. Manual note-taking is inefficient in such situations and may lead to lost ideas. There
is a need for a convenient, accurate, and accessible system to convert voice inputs into
structured digital notes.

Objectives :
Enable Hands-free Note-taking: Allow users to create and store notes using voice commands
without the need for physical input.
Improve Information Capture Speed: Provide a faster alternative to typing, helping users
capture ideas in real time.
Enhance Accessibility and Usability: Support users with physical impairments or those
working in environments where typing is impractical.

Methodology:
Problem Analysis: Identified the inefficiencies of manual note-taking and the potential
benefits of voice-based interaction.

Speech Input Integration: Used speech recognition APIs (e.g., Google or IBM Watson) to
convert spoken words into text.
Note Structuring: Applied NLP to segment voice input into clear and categorized notes (e.g.,
to-do lists, reminders, memos).
Voice Command Recognition: Implemented command-based controls (e.g., ‚Äúsave note,‚Äù
‚Äúread last memo‚Äù) for easy interaction.
Testing and Validation: Tested the system across various accents and environments to ensure
accuracy and responsiveness.

Sample Code:
!pip install SpeechRecognition pandas
! pip install pandas pyttsx

print("Upload your ZIP file containing .wav files:")
uploaded = files.upload()
import os
import zipfile
extract_folder = "extracted_audio"
os.makedirs(extract_folder, exist_ok=True)
for zip_filename in uploaded.keys():
if zip_filename.endswith('.zip'):
with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_filename, 'r') as zip_ref:
zip_ref.extractall(extract_folder)

print(f"Extracted ZIP file to folder: {extract_folder}")
else:
print(f"‚ùå {zip_filename} is not a ZIP file.")
print("Files extracted:")
print(os.listdir(extract_folder))
import os
import zipfile
from google.colab import files
import speech_recognition as sr

Step 1: Upload and unzip
uploaded = files.upload() # Upload a zip with .wav files
zip_file_name = list(uploaded.keys())[0]
extract_path = "Notes"
with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file_name, 'r') as zip_ref:
zip_ref.extractall(extract_path)
print(f"\n‚úÖ Extracted to '{extract_path}'")

Step 2: Find all .wav files in all subfolders
wav_files = []
for root, dirs, files_in_dir in os.walk(extract_path):

print("üéß Found the following .wav files:")
for wf in wav_files:
print(" -", wf)

Step 3: Recognize and write to output file
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
output_file = "Notes_output.txt"
with open(output_file, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
for wav_path in wav_files:
filename = os.path.basename(wav_path)
print(f"\nüîÑ Processing {filename}...")
try:
with sr.AudioFile(wav_path) as source:
audio_data = recognizer.record(source)
command = recognizer.recognize_google(audio_data)
print(f"‚úÖ Recognized: {command}")
f.write(f"{filename}: {command}\n")

except sr.UnknownValueError:
print(f"‚ö† Could not understand audio in {filename}.")
f.write(f"{filename}: Could not understand audio.\n")
except sr.RequestError as e:
print(f"‚ùå API error for {filename}: {e}")
f.write(f"{filename}: API error - {e}\n")
print(f"\nüìÅ All recognized commands saved to '{output_file}'")

Real-time Subtitling for Live Events
Introduction :
In an increasingly global and inclusive environment, real-time subtitling has emerged as
a powerful tool for enhancing accessibility and audience engagement during live events.
Whether for individuals with hearing impairments or non-native language speakers, real-time
subtitles provide an immediate textual representation of spoken content, bridging
communication gaps.
This project focuses on developing a real-time subtitling system using automatic speech
recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies. The system captures
live audio from events, transcribes it instantly, and displays synchronized subtitles to the
audience.

Problem Statement :
Live events often lack accessibility features such as subtitles, limiting participation for
diverse audiences. Manual transcription is slow, expensive, and prone to delays, making it
unsuitable for dynamic, real-time environments. This project addresses the need for a
scalable, accurate, and automated solution for live subtitling.

Objectives :
Enhance Accessibility: Provide real-time subtitles to support hearing-impaired users and
multilingual audiences.

broadcasts, conferences, and public events.

Methodology:
Problem Analysis: Assessed the challenges in live event accessibility and the limitations of
manual subtitling.
Audio Capture and Processing: Integrated real-time audio feed from live events for speech
input.
Speech Recognition Engine: Utilized tools like Google Speech-to-Text API or DeepSpeech to
transcribe spoken words into text.

Subtitle Formatting: Applied NLP techniques for punctuation, sentence segmentation, and
delay minimization.
Display and Sync: Designed a user interface for displaying synchronized subtitles on screens
or personal devices.
Testing and Validation: Conducted pilot tests at mock events to measure latency, accuracy,
and user feedback.

Sample Code:
from google.colab import files
import zipfile, os, time import
speech_recognition as sr

Upload and extract ZIP uploaded =
files.upload() zip_file =
list(uploaded.keys())[0] extract_path =
"live_audio" with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_file, 'r')
as zip_ref:
zip_ref.extractall(extract_path)
recognizer = sr.Recognizer() subtitle_file =
"live_subtitles.txt"

Find all wav files audio_files = [] for root, _,
files_in_dir in os.walk(extract_path): for file in
sorted(files_in_dir):
if file.lower().endswith(".wav"):
audio_files.append(os.path.join(root, file))
with open(subtitle_file, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f: f.write("===
Live Subtitles ===\n")

for filepath in audio_files: with
sr.AudioFile(filepath) as source:
audio = recognizer.record(source) try:
text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
timestamp = time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')
print(f"[{timestamp}] {text}") with open(subtitle_file,
"a", encoding="utf-8") as f: f.write(f"[{timestamp}]
{text}\n") except sr.UnknownValueError:
print(f"[{time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')}] Could not understand.") except
sr.RequestError as e:
print(f"[{time.strftime('%H:%M:%S')}] API error: {e}") time.sleep(1)
Input Format:
A ZIP file containing one or more .wav audio files representing audio segments to be
transcribed.

Output Format:
A plain text file named 'live_subtitles.txt' containing timestamped subtitles in the
following format:
[HH:MM:SS] Transcribed speech text

Result :
The system successfully transcribed each audio segment and appended the recognized text
with timestamps to the subtitle file, simulating live subtitle generation.
Sample Output:
Testing and Validation:
The system was tested with multiple WAV files of varying lengths and speech clarity.
Recognition accuracy was validated by comparing transcribed text to the original
speech. Error handling was tested by including noisy and silent audio clips.

Conclusion:
The implementation of a real-time subtitling system significantly enhances the inclusivity
and accessibility of live events. By leveraging speech recognition and NLP, this solution
offers a reliable and scalable approach to live transcription. Future improvements could

involve multilingual translation and speaker identification for even broader applications.
